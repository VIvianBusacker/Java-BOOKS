Even despite the fact that in video you will see main concepts related to specific topic, I encourage all students to read books. Why? Our brain works the way it cannot consume 100% of information. And even in case you will review the video lessons multiple times, your brain will skip some details unintentionally. To ensure you absorb as much information as you can, I recommend you to read the same topic in different books. In this document I will tell you where you can download these books. 

Here recommended literature for this course:
Java: The Complete Reference - Herbert Schildt
Thinking in Java - Bruce Eckel
Core Java Volume I - Fundamentals - Cay S. Horstmann 


	These are the best books which helped to grow up for a few generations of Java developers.
	I would recommend during your learning read the same topic in different books. That will guarantee that you understand a specific topic, because you will learn it from different points of view.
	During the course in the homework you will find reference to one of the books. For example: “Read chapter #N, about primitive types in ‘Java: The Complete Reference’ ”. In this case, feel free to find the same topic in other books in Table of Contents and read it.
